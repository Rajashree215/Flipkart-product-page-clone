# Flipkart-product-page-clone
A flipkart product page clone using HTML and CSS.

I've done this project only for educational purpose. I took the official Flipkart page as reference and tried as my best to clone that using HTML and CSS.

The images I used are taken from the official site and used only for educational purpose.

The reference page link:
